This library is intended to provide easy use of ADS in ADS client applications running on systems without local TwinCAT/ADS router.

To build this library a recent compiler with C++11 support is required. C++14 might follow soon, so keep your toolchain up to date.

Currently (2015-07-24) tested with:
===================================
Ubuntu 14.04 LTS x86_64 | gcc 4.9.2
OSX 10.10               | clang 3.5
Win7 64-bit             | gcc 4.9.3 + cygwin64
Win7 64-bit             | gcc 4.9.3 + cygwin32
Win7 64-bit             | MS Visual C++ 2013 (untended)


compile & usage
===============
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Beckhoff/ADS.git

# change into root of the cloned repository
cd ADS

# build the library
make

# copy compiled lib and headers to your client application
make install

# by default this will copy library and headers into the example/ subdirectory
# to change the target location adjust $(INSTALL_DIR) in the Makefile



prepare your target to run the example
======================================
- download your PLC project to your target e.g. "PCL-TestProject"
- on your target add an AMS route to your client. The client's AMS NetId is derived from it's IP address, which is used to connect to your target. ".1.1" is appended to that IP.
e.g.: ip: 192.168.0.1 -> ams: 192.168.0.1.1.1
- set "remoteNetId" and "remoteIpV4" in "example/example.cpp" according to your own setup

# make sure you are in the correct directory
cd example/

# build
make

# and run the example
make test
