

git clone https://github.com/Beckhoff/ADS.git
cd ADS/


compile AdsLib:
===============
make

# copy compiled lib and headers to example/ subdirectory
make install_example


prepare your target:
====================
- add ams route:
The ams address of your client is derived from it's ip address, which is used to connect to your target.
- download your PLC project to your target e.g. "PCL-TestProject"

ip + ".1.1" -> ams NetId
e.g.: ip: 192.168.0.1 -> ams: 192.168.0.1.1.1

prepare example/example.cpp:
- set "remoteNetId" and "remoteIpV4"

build and run the example:
==========================
cd example/
make
make test
